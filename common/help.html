Welcome to Direct Currency Converter 2.8.
</p>
<p>
    In order to make DCC more reliable, this version can get its currency quotes from three different sources.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>ECB (33 currencies, default)</li>
    <li>Currencylayer (168 currencies, requires a free or paid API key)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The data source is selected in the DCC options.
    The easiest way is to use ECB.
    If you need more currencies, <a href="https://currencylayer.com/">Currencylayer</a> is recommended.
    You need an API key that is available from their site.
    Store the key in the DCC settings, and you are ready to go.
