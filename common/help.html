Welcome to Direct Currency Converter (DCC) 3.4.0.
</p>
<p>
    This version is using Chrome Manifest V3, meaning that it will continue to work with the Google Chrome browser.
</p>
<p>
    News: the conversion of prices on a newly opened browser tab will be done only when you press the $€ icon (it turns green).
</p>
<p>
    News: the menu is removed for now.
</p>
<p>
    DCC can get its currency quotes from two different data sources.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>ECB (33 currencies, default)</li>
    <li>Currencylayer (168 currencies, requires a free or paid API key)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The data source is selected in the DCC options.
    The easiest way is to use ECB.
    If you need more currencies, <a href="https://currencylayer.com/">Currencylayer</a> is recommended.
    You need an API key that is available from their site.
    Store the key in the DCC settings, and you are ready to go.
