<h1>Direct Currency Converter</h1>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>
    Welcome to Direct Currency Converter (DCC) 3.4.0.
</p>
<p>
    The conversion of prices on a newly opened browser tab will be done only when you press the $€ icon (it turns
    green).
</p>
<p>
    DCC can get its currency quotes from two different data sources.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>ECB (33 currencies, default)</li>
    <li>Currencylayer (168 currencies, requires a free or paid API key)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The data source is selected in the DCC options.<br>
    The easiest way is to use ECB.<br>
    If you need more currencies, <a href="https://currencylayer.com/">Currencylayer</a> is recommended.<br>
    You need an API key that is available from their site.<br>
    Store the key in the DCC settings, and you are ready to go.
</p>
